            "summary": "Rio Tinto (RIO) Is Up 4.93% in One Week: What You Should KnowZacks Equity ResearchThu, January 22, 2026 at 6:00 AM GMT+134 min readIn this article:RIORTNTFRTPPFMomentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In \"long context,\" investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look atRio Tinto (RIO), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Rio Tinto currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of \"A or B\" outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if RIO is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this miner holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For RIO, shares are up 4.93% over the past week while the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry is up 5% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 5.82% compares favorably with the industry's 14.67% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Rio Tinto have increased 19.02% over the past quarter, and have gained 38.8% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 1.25% and 14.72%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to RIO's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. RIO is currently averaging 3,509,2",

Silver did even better, surging over 150%. That momentum has carried into 2026, with both metals hitting fresh highs as geopolitical tensions push investors toward safe-haven assets. But with gold and silver at record levels, many investors are wondering if they missed the boat.While precious metals still have more room to run, another metal is looking like the next big opportunity. Copper, often called the backbone of the global economy, is quietly stepping into the spotlight. The red metal rose around 40% last year, with prices set to strengthen as new demand drivers kick in.After gold and silver\u2019s historic runs, it\u2019s copper\u2019s turn to shine red hot. Investing in copper stocks likeEro Copper Corp.ERO,BHP GroupLimitedBHP,Rio Tinto PLCRIO andSouthern Copper CorporationSCCO could be a smart way to play the trend.The Red Metal\u2019s MomentOne early spark for copper\u2019s rally came last year, when U.S. companies rushed to stockpile supplies after President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on copper imports. Even though those tariffs were later put on hold, the buying frenzy drained inventories and tightened supplies across global markets. At the same time, disruptions at major mines in countries like Chile, Peru and Indonesia limited output growth, keeping the market under pressure.Demand trends are just as powerful. Copper is essential to electric vehicles, power grids, renewable energy systems and industrial machinery. It is also becoming a critical input for the fast-growing AI economy. Massive data centers used for artificial intelligence and cloud computing require enormous amounts of copper for wiring, power transmission and cooling systems. Some hyperscale facilities consume tens of thousands of tons on their own.China, the world\u2019s largest copper consumer and manufacturer, is also moving aggressively to secure long-term supplies. This adds another layer of demand to an already tight market.Demand is growing faster than supply, and experts say this is a lasting shortage rather than a temporary supply squeeze.With a weakening U.S. dollar, rising investor interest, strong demand and supply crunch, copper is increasingly being viewed as both a growth play and a hedge.Copper Stocks to Own in 2026Ero Copperis a Brazil-focused mining company producing copper and gold. It runs two copper mines\u2014Cara\u00edba in Bahia and Tucum\u00e3 in Par\u00e1\u2014and a gold mine, Xavantina, in Mato Grosso. In the third quarter of 2025, copper production hit a record 16,664 tonnes of concentrate at a low cash cost of $2 per pound, driven by stronger output at Tucum\u00e3 and steady production at Cara\u00edba.Story continuesThe company expects fourth-quarter 2025 production to have received a boost from higher plant throughput and richer mining blocks at Tucum\u00e3.

This change is grounded in revised assumptions around revenue growth and the Discount Rate, with the discount rate move from 8.79% to 8.80% highlighting how even small tweaks to required returns can influence the final price target.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus onNeuren Pharmaceuticals'ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.How To Calculate Return On Equity?Theformula for ROEis:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Neuren Pharmaceuticals is:46% = AU$149m \u00f7 AU$323m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.46.View our latest analysis for Neuren PharmaceuticalsWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.Neuren Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 46% ROETo begin with, Neuren Pharmaceuticals has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 6.8% the company's ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 68% net income growth seen by Neuren Pharmaceuticals over the past five years isn't overly surprising.As a next step, we compared Neuren Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 9.3%.ASX:NEU Past Earnings Growth January 12th 2026The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want toch",

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies likeNeuren Pharmaceuticals(ASX:NEU), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Neuren Pharmaceuticals with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.Neuren Pharmaceuticals' Improving ProfitsIn the last three years Neuren Pharmaceuticals' earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. To the delight of shareholders, Neuren Pharmaceuticals' EPS soared from AU$0.92 to AU$1.18, over the last year. That's a impressive gain of 29%.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Neuren Pharmaceuticals is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 3.7 percentage points to 84%, over the last year.

It looks to have been a decent result overall - while revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates at AU$28m, statutory earnings beat expectations by a notable 191%, coming in at AU$0.12 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.ASX:NEU Earnings and Revenue Growth August 28th 2025Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus, from the seven analysts covering Neuren Pharmaceuticals, is for revenues of AU$65.0m in 2025. This implies a sizeable 70% reduction in Neuren Pharmaceuticals' revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to nosedive 90% to AU$0.12 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of AU$65.9m and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.17 in 2025. The analysts seem to have become more bearish following the latest results. While there were no changes to revenue forecasts, there was a large cut to EPS estimates.See our latest analysis for Neuren PharmaceuticalsThe consensus price target held steady at AU$24.19, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Neuren Pharmaceuticals at AU$30.50 per share, while the most bearish prices it at AU$18.60. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Neuren Pharmaceuticals' past performance and to peers in the sameindustry. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 91% by the end of 2025. This indicates a significant reduction from ",

He puffed. But President Trump didn't blow down a shaky stock market a day after itplunged because of renewed tariff fears.Trump used his bully pulpit at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday to hit all his classic notes. During an hour-plus speech, he attacked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for being \"too late\" to cut interest rates. He suggested for the first time that Powell's replacement will be a man.He even set in motion plans to stop institutions from buying single-family homes, but did apologize to his billionaire friends (see Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman, whose firm stands to lose) in the audience about doing so.Above all else, Trump said he would not use force to seize control of Greenland, a country that he frequently panned as a \"piece of ice.\"That was enough for a jittery market to scry that Trump won't go nuclear with his latest tariff threat against Europe.As of this writing, all three major indexes were in the green. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was leading the way with a 0.6% gain. Investors returned to richly valued momentum stocks such as AMD (AMD) and Google (GOOG).Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESSIn effect, he made the loyal buy-the-dip market goers happy from hundreds of miles away.\"He was direct and to the point,\" Kace Capital Advisors managing partner Kenny Polcari said.It was a sentiment shared throughout Wall Street as Trump's speech was digested by trading desks.\"For now, yes, [it quiets the market down],\" Crossmark Global Investments chief markets strategist Victoria Fernandez said. \"The statement that force would not be used on Greenland (which I think we all knew already, but good to hear him say it) was very helpful.\"Also helpful: a bullish speech on AI at Davos from Trump CEO bestie, and first-time WEF attendee, Jensen Huang.The Nvidia (NVDA) co-founder \u2014 sporting his trademark black leather coat \u2014 said he's seeing a \"boom\" in trade jobs and six-figure salaries for those helping to build out AI infrastructure.\"Everyone should be able to make a great living,\" Huang said. He added that he anticipates the current wave of AI will lead to the \"largest infrastructure build-out in human history\" involving trillions of dollars.He also pushed back, again, on the notion of there being an AI bubble.What a difference a day makes for sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite allsuffered heavy losses on Tuesday, with investors bidding upsafe-haven assets like gold(GC=F).

As in prior quarters, questions remain about how companies are monetizing their vast investments in the red-hot technology and whether hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG,GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) and social media giant Meta (META) will continue to increase spending.Investors will also be interested in PC chip sales from AMD (AMD) and Intel, which could get a boost thanks to Microsoft\u2019s decision to end support for Windows 10. But the ongoing global memory shortage could put a damper on their sales outlooks.Apple\u2019s earnings will also be in the spotlight, as investors anticipate solid growth on the back of strong iPhone sales in the fourth quarter.And then there\u2019s Nvidia (NVDA). The company\u2019s future in China remains a major question mark as the chipmaker attempts to reestablish its business in one of the world\u2019s most important AI markets.AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su delivers a keynote address at CES 2023 at The Venetian Las Vegas on January 04, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)\u00b7David Becker via Getty ImagesBut with President Trump threatening a new round of steep tariffs on European countries over his desire to acquire Greenland, even positive earnings reports might not be enough to buoy stocks.With so many trends colliding, expect it to be a nonstop barrage of news. I hope you\u2019re ready.AI spending, revenue, and winnersAmazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are some of the biggest AI spenders around. And their results will have ripple effects on AI companies across the market.All four of the companies plan to keep pouring cash into building data centers. During Amazon\u2019s third quarter earnings call, CFO Brian Olsavsky said that thecompany planned to spend $125 billionin 2025 and even more in 2026.Google CFO Anat Ashkenazi raised the company\u2019s 2025 capital expenditures in Q3 to between $91 billion and $93 billion, up from a previously anticipated $85 billion, and added that the amountwould increase significantly in 2026.Meta CFO Susan Li provided a similar update to theFacebook parent\u2019s 2025 capital expenditures, increasing her projection on the low end from between $66 billion and $72 billion to between $70 billion and $72 billion.She also added that she anticipates \u201ctotal expenses will grow at a significantly faster percentage rate in 2026 than 2025, with growth driven primarily by infrastructure costs, including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation.\u201dEmployee compensation would be the second-biggest driver.

(NASDAQ:META)is one of theAI Stocks on Market Radar.On January 14, Truist Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with an $875.00 price target. While META has underperformed peers since Q3 earnings, the firm believes investor fears are already priced in.In an investor note, the firm noted how Meta has underperformed its peers since the third-quarter earnings due to concerns about capital and operating expenditure plans for 2026. Moreover, Llama 4\u2019s disappointing performance has fueled perceptions that the company is lagging behind other major tech firms in artificial intelligence.Truist Securities believes that Meta\u2019s valuation already reflects many of these fears. However, it fails to reflect on the potential to grow faster for longer and catch up in AI development.Meta's valuation at 20x P/E vs. GOOGL and AMZN at 30x+ already reflects much of those fear but fails to reflect its potential to grow faster for longer and ability to catch up in AI, in our view.The research firm remains constructive heading into earnings, anticipating META\u2019s results to be at the higher end of expectations, driven by robust user engagement and higher monetization stemming from better ranking and recommendations.For 1Q, we expect both the revenue and Capex/Opex guides to bracket consensus ests.While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

See the full list for free.What Is Alphabet's Investment Narrative?To own Alphabet today, you have to believe it can keep compounding its already huge US$385.48 billion revenue base at a healthy clip while defending its core search and ads engine, and turning AI, Cloud and \u201cOther Bets\u201d into meaningful profit contributors over time. The Apple\u2013Gemini deal slots directly into that thesis: it reinforces Gemini as a top-tier model and could add a new, high-margin stream on top of existing Google Cloud and API demand, potentially strengthening near term catalysts like AI-related ad products and cloud workloads. At the same time, it subtly shifts the risk profile. Regulatory scrutiny around data and competitive behavior, Apple\u2019s bargaining power over time, heavy AI capex, and a rich 31.9x earnings multiple all matter more when a single flagship partnership becomes central to the story.But there is a less obvious long term risk tied to this Apple dependency that investors should understand. Alphabet's share price has been on the slide but might be up to 5% below fair value.Find out if it's a bargain.Exploring Other PerspectivesGOOGL 1-Year Stock Price ChartThe 202 fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$171 to US$390 per share, with some members seeing Alphabet as deeply undervalued and others as stretched. Set against that spread of opinions, the new Apple\u2013Gemini partnership, ongoing AI capex and regulatory overhangs give you plenty of moving parts to weigh when you think about how sustainable Alphabet\u2019s recent performance really is.
