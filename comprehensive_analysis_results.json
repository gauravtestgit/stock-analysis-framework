            "summary": "Some Analysts Just Cut Their Peoplein Limited (ASX:PPE) EstimatesSimply Wall StDecember 24, 20253 min readIn this article:PPE.AXToday is shaping up negative forPeoplein Limited(ASX:PPE) shareholders, with the analysts delivering a substantial negative revision to this year's forecasts. Revenue estimates were cut sharply as analysts signalled a weaker outlook - perhaps a sign that investors should temper their expectations as well. Shares are up 4.2% to AU$0.87 in the past week. Investors could be forgiven for changing their mind on the business following the downgrade; but it's not clear if the revised forecasts will lead to selling activity.We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.Following the downgrade, the consensus from three analysts covering Peoplein is for revenues of AU$945m in 2026, implying a not inconsiderable 14% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. The losses are expected to disappear over the next year or so, with forecasts for a profit of AU$0.074 per share this year. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of AU$1.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.094 in 2026. It looks like analyst sentiment has declined substantially, with a substantial drop in revenue estimates and a large cut to earnings per share numbers as well.See our latest analysis for PeopleinASX:PPE Earnings and Revenue Growth December 23rd 2025Analysts made no major changes to their price target of AU$1.15, suggesting the downgrades are not expected to have a long-term impact on Peoplein's valuation.One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 14% by the end of 2026. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 24% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 3.7% annually for the foreseeable future. It's pretty clear that Peoplein's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry.The Bottom LineThe most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their earnings per share estimates, expecting a clear decline in business conditions. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and the latest forecasts imply the business will grow sales slower than the wider market. Often, one downgrade can set off a daisy-chain of cuts, especially if an industry is in decline. So we wouldn't be surprised if the market became a lot more cautious on Peoplein after today.Story ContinuesStill, the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

            "summary": "Neuren Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX:NEU) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?Simply Wall StJanuary 13, 20263 min readIn this article:NURPFIt is hard to get excited after looking at Neuren Pharmaceuticals' (ASX:NEU) recent performance, when its stock has declined 5.6% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus onNeuren Pharmaceuticals'ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.How To Calculate Return On Equity?Theformula for ROEis:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Neuren Pharmaceuticals is:46% = AU$149m \u00f7 AU$323m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.46.View our latest analysis for Neuren PharmaceuticalsWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.Neuren Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 46% ROETo begin with, Neuren Pharmaceuticals has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 6.8% the company's ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 68% net income growth seen by Neuren Pharmaceuticals over the past five years isn't overly surprising.As a next step, we compared Neuren Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 9.3%.ASX:NEU Past Earnings Growth January 12th 2026The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want toch",

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies likeNeuren Pharmaceuticals(ASX:NEU), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Neuren Pharmaceuticals with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.Neuren Pharmaceuticals' Improving ProfitsIn the last three years Neuren Pharmaceuticals' earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. To the delight of shareholders, Neuren Pharmaceuticals' EPS soared from AU$0.92 to AU$1.18, over the last year. That's a impressive gain of 29%.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Neuren Pharmaceuticals is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 3.7 percentage points to 84%, over the last year.

It looks to have been a decent result overall - while revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates at AU$28m, statutory earnings beat expectations by a notable 191%, coming in at AU$0.12 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.ASX:NEU Earnings and Revenue Growth August 28th 2025Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus, from the seven analysts covering Neuren Pharmaceuticals, is for revenues of AU$65.0m in 2025. This implies a sizeable 70% reduction in Neuren Pharmaceuticals' revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to nosedive 90% to AU$0.12 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of AU$65.9m and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.17 in 2025. The analysts seem to have become more bearish following the latest results.

He puffed. But President Trump didn't blow down a shaky stock market a day after itplunged because of renewed tariff fears.Trump used his bully pulpit at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday to hit all his classic notes. During an hour-plus speech, he attacked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for being \"too late\" to cut interest rates. He suggested for the first time that Powell's replacement will be a man.He even set in motion plans to stop institutions from buying single-family homes, but did apologize to his billionaire friends (see Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman, whose firm stands to lose) in the audience about doing so.Above all else, Trump said he would not use force to seize control of Greenland, a country that he frequently panned as a \"piece of ice.\"That was enough for a jittery market to scry that Trump won't go nuclear with his latest tariff threat against Europe.As of this writing, all three major indexes were in the green. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was leading the way with a 0.6% gain. Investors returned to richly valued momentum stocks such as AMD (AMD) and Google (GOOG).Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026.

He added that he anticipates the current wave of AI will lead to the \"largest infrastructure build-out in human history\" involving trillions of dollars.He also pushed back, again, on the notion of there being an AI bubble.What a difference a day makes for sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite allsuffered heavy losses on Tuesday, with investors bidding upsafe-haven assets like gold(GC=F).

As in prior quarters, questions remain about how companies are monetizing their vast investments in the red-hot technology and whether hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG,GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) and social media giant Meta (META) will continue to increase spending.Investors will also be interested in PC chip sales from AMD (AMD) and Intel, which could get a boost thanks to Microsoft\u2019s decision to end support for Windows 10. But the ongoing global memory shortage could put a damper on their sales outlooks.Apple\u2019s earnings will also be in the spotlight, as investors anticipate solid growth on the back of strong iPhone sales in the fourth quarter.And then there\u2019s Nvidia (NVDA). The company\u2019s future in China remains a major question mark as the chipmaker attempts to reestablish its business in one of the world\u2019s most important AI markets.AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su delivers a keynote address at CES 2023 at The Venetian Las Vegas on January 04, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)\u00b7David Becker via Getty ImagesBut with President Trump threatening a new round of steep tariffs on European countries over his desire to acquire Greenland, even positive earnings reports might not be enough to buoy stocks.With so many trends colliding, expect it to be a nonstop barrage of news. I hope you\u2019re ready.AI spending, revenue, and winnersAmazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are some of the biggest AI spenders around. And their results will have ripple effects on AI companies across the market.All four of the companies plan to keep pouring cash into building data centers. During Amazon\u2019s third quarter earnings call, CFO Brian Olsavsky said that thecompany planned to spend $125 billionin 2025 and even more in 2026.Google CFO Anat Ashkenazi raised the company\u2019s 2025 capital expenditures in Q3 to between $91 billion and $93 billion, up from a previously anticipated $85 billion, and added that the amountwould increase significantly in 2026.Meta CFO Susan Li provided a similar update to theFacebook parent\u2019s 2025 capital expenditures, increasing her projection on the low end from between $66 billion and $72 billion to between $70 billion and $72 billion.She also added that she anticipates \u201ctotal expenses will grow at a significantly faster percentage rate in 2026 than 2025, with growth driven primarily by infrastructure costs, including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation.\u201dEmployee compensation would be the second-biggest driver.

Nvidia: The king of AI infrastructureNvidia(NVDA+2.98%)has been at the forefront of the AI boom, and it has the moat in place to continue to be the AI infrastructure leader over the next decade.This moat starts with itsCUDAsoftware platform, where most foundational AI tools and libraries have been written and optimized for itsgraphics processing units (GPUs). It then moves into networking, where its proprietary NVLink interconnect system shares pooled memory and speeds up communication between its chips, allowing them to act like one powerful unit. At the same time, itscentral processing units (CPUs), data processing units (DPUs), and other networking components let it deliver turnkey AI supercomputers.ExpandNASDAQ:NVDANvidiaToday's Change(2.98%) $5.31Current Price$183.38Key Data PointsMarket Cap$4.3TDay's Range$178.43- $185.3752wk Range$86.62- $212.19Volume6.4MAvg Vol185MGross Margin70.05%Dividend Yield0.02%Both companies and countries are in an AI gold rush, and Nvidia is the primary pick-and-shovel provider. Data center infrastructure spending is expected to remain robust for a very long time, which sets up Nvidia to continue to be a long-term AI winner. Meanwhile, with the stock trading at aforward price-to-earnings (P/E)ratio of approximately 24.5 times analyst estimates and aprice/earnings-to-growth (PEG)ratio of less than 0.7 times (with PEGs below 1 generally considered undervalued), it is attractively priced.Advertisement2. Alphabet: A vertical integration advantageWith the most complete AI stack of any company,Alphabet(GOOGL+2.01%)(GOOG+1.97%)is primed to be a long-term AI winner. The company has developed its own world-class custom AI chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which it has used to train its top-tier AI model Gemini. It has then infused Gemini throughout its products, including Google Search, to help drive growth. On top of that, it is now starting to let customers use its TPUs with Google Cloud to help them power their own AI workloads.ExpandNASDAQ:GOOGLAlphabetToday's Change(2.01%) $6.46Current Price$328.46Key Data PointsMarket Cap$3.9TDay's Range$319.37- $332.4452wk Range$140.53- $340.49Volume1.1MAvg Vol37MGross Margin59.18%Dividend Yield0.26%Alphabet hasn't stopped there, though. The company also owns top-notch AI software, like Vertex AI, and has its own large-scale fiber network. It's also in the process of buying leading data center cybersecurity company Wiz and data center energy company Intersect.With energy being one of the biggest AI infrastructure bottlenecks, the Intersect deal should help the company be able to more quickly build out new data centers.
