Despite this quiet period, investors may find intriguing opportunities in penny stocks, a term that might seem outdated but still signifies potential growth avenues in smaller or emerging companies. These stocks can offer significant returns when backed by strong financials; let's explore three such promising picks on the ASX that could present hidden value and resilience.Top 10 Penny Stocks In AustraliaNameShare PriceMarket CapFinancial Health RatingAlfabs Australia (ASX:AAL)A$0.405A$111.77M\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606EZZ Life Science Holdings (ASX:EZZ)A$1.39A$66.04M\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Dusk Group (ASX:DSK)A$0.78A$48.57M\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605IVE Group (ASX:IGL)A$3.00A$456.46M\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606MotorCycle Holdings (ASX:MTO)A$3.14A$230.45M\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Veris (ASX:VRS)A$0.074A$39.99M\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605West African Resources (ASX:WAF)A$3.14A$3.44B\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Service Stream (ASX:SSM)A$2.26A$1.37B\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605EDU Holdings (ASX:EDU)A$0.825A$121.62M\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606MaxiPARTS (ASX:MXI)A$2.26A$124.98M\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Click here to see the full list of 420 stocks from our ASX Penny Stocks screener.We'll examine a selection from our screener results.Botanix PharmaceuticalsSimply Wall St Financial Health Rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606Overview:Botanix Pharmaceuticals Limited is a commercial dermatology company operating in Australia and the United States with a market capitalization of A$246.33 million.Operations:The company generates revenue from its Research and Development Dermatology and Antimicrobial Products segment, amounting to A$5.79 million.Market Cap:A$246.33MBotanix Pharmaceuticals, with a market cap of A$246.33 million, is a commercial dermatology company that remains pre-revenue despite generating A$5.79 million from its R&D segment.

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been very strong. In fact, the share price is up a full 126% compared to three years ago. It's not uncommon to see a share price retrace a bit, after a big gain. The fundamental business performance will ultimately dictate whether the top is in, or if this is a stellar buying opportunity.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.Given that Botanix Pharmaceuticals didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally hope to see good revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.Botanix Pharmaceuticals actually saw its revenue drop by 11% per year over three years. So the share price gain of 31% per year is quite surprising. It's fair to say shareholders are definitely counting on a bright future.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).ASX:BOT Earnings and Revenue Growth December 29th 2025Take a more thorough look at Botanix Pharmaceuticals' financial health with thisfreereport on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveBotanix Pharmaceuticals shareholders are down 72% for the year, but the market itself is up 10%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.8% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since 2005, you'd have done very well indeed. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.So, the natural question forBotanix Pharmaceuticals(ASX:BOT) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. For the purposes of this article, cash burn is the annual rate at which an unprofitable company spends cash to fund its growth; its negative free cash flow. We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway.We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.Does Botanix Pharmaceuticals Have A Long Cash Runway?A cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. As at June 2025, Botanix Pharmaceuticals had cash of AU$65m and no debt. In the last year, its cash burn was AU$80m. That means it had a cash runway of around 10 months as of June 2025. Notably, analysts forecast that Botanix Pharmaceuticals will break even (at a free cash flow level) in about 2 years. That means unless the company reduces its cash burn quickly, it may well look to raise more cash. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.ASX:BOT Debt to Equity History November 20th 2025See our latest analysis for Botanix PharmaceuticalsHow Well Is Botanix Pharmaceuticals Growing?One thing for shareholders to keep front in mind is that Botanix Pharmaceuticals increased its cash burn by 205% in the last twelve months. It seems likely that the vociferous operating revenue growth of 180% during that time may well have given management confidence to ramp investment. In light of the data above, we're fairly sanguine about the business growth trajectory. While the past is always worth studying, it is the future that matters most of all. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look atour analyst forecasts for the company.Can Botanix Pharmaceuticals Raise More Cash Easily?Given the trajectory of Botanix Pharmaceuticals' cash burn, many investors will already be thinking about how it might raise more cash in the future. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.Story continuesBotanix Pharmaceutica",

These include the appointment of Andrew Bickley as Joint Company Secretary, fresh details on Sofdra gel\u2019s launch, and an upcoming conference presentation.See our latest analysis for Botanix Pharmaceuticals.While recent management updates and conference news have spotlighted Botanix Pharmaceuticals, shares are still working to recover from a challenging year, with a 1-year total shareholder return of -54.7%. However, the strong 3-year total shareholder return of 130.2% shows that past momentum hasn\u2019t been forgotten, and investors are watching for new catalysts and signs that the long-term growth story could pick up again.If the company\u2019s evolving leadership and industry activity have you curious, now might be the right time to discoverfast growing stocks with high insider ownershipGiven the company\u2019s volatile returns, ambitious revenue growth and recent operational changes, are Botanix Pharmaceuticals shares currently undervalued or has the market already factored in future catalysts and left little room for upside?Price-to-Sales of 49.4x: Is it justified?With Botanix Pharmaceuticals trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 49.4x, the stock appears significantly more expensive than both industry peers and fair value benchmarks. The last close at A$0.15 reflects this premium pricing when compared to other Australian pharmaceutical companies.The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company's revenue, serving as a key benchmark for firms still working towards profitability. For emerging pharma businesses, high ratios can signal robust growth expectations or, in some cases, an overheated valuation.Botanix's P/S of 49.4x is more than three times the Australian Pharmaceuticals industry average of 14.9x, and considerably higher than the estimated fair P/S ratio of 7.8x. This points to a substantial disconnect between the market price and underlying fundamentals, with investors currently paying a notable premium above both sector and fair value levels.Explore the SWS fair ratio for Botanix PharmaceuticalsResult: Price-to-Sales of 49.4x (OVERVALUED)However, slowing near-term revenue growth and the company\u2019s persistent net losses remain key risks. These factors could undermine bullish expectations moving forward.Find out about the key risks to this Botanix Pharmaceuticals narrative.Another View: DCF Suggests Deep ValueWhile the price-to-sales multiple paints Botanix Pharmaceuticals as expensive, the SWS DCF model offers a remarkably different angle. According to our DCF, the current share price of A$0.15 is trading well below an estimated fair value of A$0.86, which suggests the stock may be substantially undervalued. Which approach",

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, theCOG Financial Services Limited(ASX:COG) share price has soared 173% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Better yet, the share price has risen 5.5% in the last week. But this could be related to the buoyant market which is up about 2.3% in a week.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the last half decade, COG Financial Services became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).ASX:COG Earnings Per Share Growth December 26th 2025We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Thisfreeinteractive report on COG Financial Services'earnings, revenue and cash flowis a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of COG Financial Services, it has a TSR of 262% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted thetotalshareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that COG Financial Services shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 139% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 29%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might b",

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 41% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained AU$59m in market cap last week. The one-year return on investment is currently 158% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of COG Financial Services.See our latest analysis for COG Financial ServicesASX:COG Ownership Breakdown October 10th 2025What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About COG Financial Services?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in COG Financial Services. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of COG Financial Services, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.ASX:COG Earnings and Revenue Growth October 10th 2025Our data indicates that hedge funds own 7.7% of COG Financial Services. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Wilson Asset Management (International) Pty Ltd. with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.3% by the third-largest shareholder. Cameron McCullagh, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Member of the Board of Directors.

Long termCOG Financial Services Limited(ASX:COG) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 218% in five years. It's also good to see the share price up 35% over the last quarter.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, COG Financial Services achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 18% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 26% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).ASX:COG Earnings Per Share Growth July 19th 2025It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at ourfreereport on COG Financial Services' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for COG Financial Services the TSR over the last 5 years was 325%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that COG Financial Services shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 74% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 34% per ",
