Liquidity measures a company\u2019s capability to meet short-term debt obligations. Stocks with high liquidity levels have always been in demand, owing to their potential to provide maximum returns.Investors may want to consider adding four top-ranked stocks\u2014Ciena Corporation(CIEN),EverQuote, Inc. (EVER),Pan American Silver Corp.(PAAS) andGigaCloudTechnology Inc.(GCT) \u2014 to their portfolios to boost returns.However, it is important to exercise caution. While high liquidity can indicate that a company is efficiently managing its short-term obligations, it may also suggest underutilization of resources. In some cases, companies with excess liquidity may not be deploying their assets effectively, which could limit growth potential.Hence, one may consider a company\u2019s efficiency level in addition to its liquidity while identifying prospective winners. A balanced assessment of both liquidity and efficiency can help identify truly promising investment opportunities.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company\u2019s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio \u2014 the working capital ratio \u2014 below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. A high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also indicate that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio \u2014 the \u201cacid-test ratio\u201d or \u201cquick assets ratio\u201d \u2014 indicates a company\u2019s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding current assets, relative to current liabilities. A quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable, like the current ratio.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company\u2019s ability to meet existing debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.A ratio greater than 1 is always desirable, but it may not always represent a company\u2019s financial condition.Screening ParametersTo pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization \u2014 a widely used measure of a company\u2019s efficiency \u2014 as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales in the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than that of their industry can be considered efficient.Sto",

The company\u2019s growth prospects remain solid in the United States, driven by favorable domestic solar demand trends.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company faces several headwinds, including heightened trade tensions and tariff risks.Factors Acting in Favor of FSLRFirst Solar has been investing heftily in the production ramp-up of its modules to expand its manufacturing capacity. The company manufactured 3.6 gigawatts (GW) in the third quarter of 2025 and sold 5.3 GW of solar modules. Its total installed nameplate production capacity across all its facilities was approximately 23.5 GW as of Sept. 30, 2025. With a strong global footprint, First Solar enjoys a solid presence in the United States, India, Malaysia and Vietnam.The company recently commenced operations at its fourth and fifth manufacturing facilities in the United States and completed the expansion of its manufacturing footprint at its existing facilities in Ohio. It has added 2.7 GW of gross bookings since the previous earnings call, bringing its total booking backlog to 54.5 GW through 2030, indicating strong demand for FSLR\u2019s products.FSLR\u2019s 2025 capital expenditure, estimated at $0.9-$1.2 billion, is focused on expanding and modernizing its operations. These investments include the construction of a new manufacturing facility, ongoing research and development initiatives, and upgrades to existing machinery and equipment aimed at enhancing efficiency and performance.Challenges Faced by FSLRIn 2025, the U.S. imposed new reciprocal tariffs on key trading partners, along with penalties for transshipment, potentially limiting First Solar\u2019s U.S. sales and affecting its international manufacturing operations and financial performance.Moreover, the United States currently imposes tariffs on various articles imported from China. In February 2025, the U.S. President announced an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China. This 10% tariff was subsequently doubled to 20% in March 2025 and applies in addition to the 25% tariffs under Section 301 and ordinary customs duties and AD/CVDs. The company\u2019s operating results could be adversely impacted if these tariffs were to be terminated or reduced.FSLR\u2019s Share Price PerformanceIn the past six months, shares of the company have risen 62.9% compared with the industry\u2019s 57.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same industry areCanadian SolarCSIQ,Tigo Energy, Inc.TYGO andFTC SolarFTCI, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

The company is benefiting from its optimized inverter solutions to address a broad range of solar market segments, from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility-scale solar installations.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company faces risks related to higher U.S. tariffs and potential trade escalations.Factors Acting in Favor of SEDGSolarEdge Technologies\u2019 optimized inverter solutions address a broad range of solar market segments, from residential solar installations to commercial and small utility-scale solar installations. Thanks to the growing solar demand in recent times, as of Sept. 30, 2025, the company shipped approximately 60.1 GW of DC optimized inverter systems and approximately 3 GWh of its batteries for PV applications. Such a solid shipment count should boost the company\u2019s future revenue growth.SEDG has also been enhancing its manufacturing capacities in the United States to reap the benefits of the long-term growth opportunities offered by this nation in terms of solid solar installation capabilities. As part of its efforts to streamline and centralize its manufacturing in the United States, SolarEdge has discontinued manufacturing in China, Mexico and Hungary. The company is also optimizing its U.S. manufacturing footprint, which now includes residential inverters in Texas, optimizers and commercial inverters in Florida, and batteries in Utah.In June 2025, SolarEdge announced the ramp-up of its new manufacturing site in Salt Lake City, UT. Following this ramp-up, SolarEdge will now produce its full U.S. residential inverter, Power Optimizer, and battery product suite on American soil. Such enhancement of SEDG\u2019s manufacturing capacity should enable it to capture more shares of the expanding U.S. solar market.Challenges Faced by SEDGThe recently imposed higher tariffs by the U.S. government on the import of goods from foreign nations have created a significant uncertainty for global trade and companies operating worldwide, with SolarEdge Technologies being no exception. Although SEDG currently manufactures the vast bulk of its products in the United States, a minor portion is still manufactured in its Israel-based Sella 1 facility. Moreover, certain critical subcomponents for SolarEdge\u2019s products are still sourced from outside the United States.Therefore, if these heightened tariffs remain or there\u2019s any escalation in trade tensions in the near term \u2014 resulting in trade restrictions or other retaliatory measures on SolarEdge\u2019s products or components or subcomponents originating from countries outside the United States \u2014 it could be detrimental to the company\u2019s growth.Story ContinuesSEDG\u2019s Share Price PerformanceIn the past six months, shares of the company have r",

            "summary": "All You Need to Know About Tigo Energy, Inc. (TYGO) Rating Upgrade to BuyZacks Equity ResearchDecember 12, 20253 min readIn this article:TYGOTigo Energy, Inc. (TYGO) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Tigo Energy, Inc. basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Tigo Energy, Inc. imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

            "summary": "4 Solar Stocks to Watch With Robust Growth & Steady Long-Term OutlookTanvi SarawagiDecember 10, 20258 min readIn this article:RUNTYGOThe U.S. solar industry is experiencing strong underlying momentum, with utilities, businesses and households increasingly adopting solar and storage. Installations reached 11.7 GWdc in the third quarter of 2025, while project delays eased. However, recent federal policy changes have created near-term uncertainty, complicating permitting, procurement and supply-chain planning. Despite a 12% drop in module prices, elevated U.S. tariffs have pushed commercial and utility-scale system costs higher. These policy and tariff pressures are squeezing margins and heightening project risk. A few prominent players in this industry that solar investors may like to watch areSunrunRUN,Canadian SolarCSIQ,FTC SolarFTCI andTigo Energy, Inc.TYGO.About the IndustryThe Zacks Solar industry can be fundamentally categorized into two groups of companies. While one is involved in designing and producing high-efficiency solar modules, panels and cells, the other is engaged in installing grids and, in some cases, entire solar power systems. The industry also includes a handful of companies that manufacture inverters for solar power systems, which convert solar power from modules into electricity required by electric grids. Per a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (\u201cSEIA\u201d), published on Dec. 8, 2025, solar accounted for 58% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the U.S. grid through the third quarter of 2025, with more than 30 gigawatt (GW) installed. Hence, it remains the nation's dominant form of new generating capacity.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Solar IndustryStrong Momentum Lifts Outlook:Utilities, businesses, and households are increasingly adopting solar power \u2014 especially systems paired with battery storage \u2014 to advance decarbonization, strengthen energy resilience and protect against rising electricity prices. As reported by SEIA, the U.S. solar industry installed 11.7 GWdc of new solar capacity during the third quarter of 2025, reflecting a 20% year-over-year increase. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (\u201cEIA\u201d) reported that solar remains the fastest-growing source of new electric-generating capacity, driven by the rapid buildout of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) projects by utilities and independent power producers. The EIA reported improvement in project timelines \u2014 just 20% of planned solar capacity faced delays in the third quarter of 2025, down from 25% a year ago. EIA also stated that developers further expect to bring 32 GW of new solar capacity online between October 2025 and September 2026. Such strong growth indicators and declining project bottlenecks should bode well for U.S. solar stocks.Regulatory Friction Rises, Yet Industry Fundamentals Remain Strong:The U.S. government has recently implemented several policy measures that may create near-term headwinds for the nation\u2019s sola",
