(NASDAQ:LXRX) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are private equity firms with 48% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Individual investors, on the other hand, account for 27% of the company's stockholders.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, beginning with the chart below.View our latest analysis for Lexicon PharmaceuticalsNasdaqCM:LXRX Ownership Breakdown December 23rd 2025What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lexicon Pharmaceuticals?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Lexicon Pharmaceuticals already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Lexicon Pharmaceuticals' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.NasdaqCM:LXRX Earnings and Revenue Growth December 23rd 2025Hedge funds don't have many shares in Lexicon Pharmaceuticals. The company's largest shareholder is Artal Group S.A., with ownership of 48%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 11% and 2.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 2 shareholders collectively control more than half of the company's shares, implying that they have considerable power to influence the company's decisions.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance.

The consensus estimated revenue numbers rose, with their view now clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects. Lexicon Pharmaceuticals has also found favour with investors, with the stock up a notable 17% to US$1.56 over the past week. We'll be curious to see if these new estimates convince the market to lift the stock price higher still.We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.Following the latest upgrade, the current consensus, from the five analysts covering Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, is for revenues of US$16m in 2026, which would reflect a sizeable 78% reduction in Lexicon Pharmaceuticals' sales over the past 12 months. Per-share losses are expected to explode, reaching US$0.27 per share. Yet prior to the latest estimates, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$12m and losses of US$0.28 per share in 2026. So there's been quite a change-up of views after the recent consensus updates, with the analysts making a sizeable increase to their revenue forecasts while also reducing the estimated loss as the business grows towards breakeven.See our latest analysis for Lexicon PharmaceuticalsNasdaqCM:LXRX Earnings and Revenue Growth November 12th 2025There was no major change to the consensus price target of US$2.88, perhaps suggesting that the analysts remain concerned about ongoing losses despite the improved earnings and revenue outlook.Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 70% by the end of 2026. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 40% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 9.3% per year. It's pretty clear that Lexicon Pharmaceuticals' revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry.The Bottom LineThe most important thing here is that analysts reduced their loss per share estimates for next year, reflecting increased optimism around Lexicon Pharmaceuticals' prospects. Pleasantly, analysts also upgraded their revenue estimates, and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow slower than the wider market. Seeing the dramatic upgrade to next year's forecasts, it might be time to take another look at Lexicon Pharmaceuticals.Story ContinuesWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's ",

This compares to a loss of $0.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of +42.86%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this drugmaker would post a loss of $0.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.01, delivering a surprise of +112.5%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Lexicon, which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $14.18 million for the quarter ended September 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 140.78%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.75 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Lexicon shares have added about 86.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 15.6%.What's Next for Lexicon?While Lexicon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Lexicon was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 2.1% loss over the past four weeks.The sudden jump in the stock price is likely fueled by the commercial performance of Ascendis Pharma\u2019s two marketed drugs, Skytrofa and Yorvipath, approved for growth hormone deficiency and hypoparathyroidism, respectively. Last week, the company reported that the unaudited preliminary fourth-quarter revenues generated by the two drugs are expected to be \u20ac53 million and \u20ac187 million, respectively. ASND is also evaluating these drugs for their label expansion into other indications.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +119.1%. Revenues are expected to be $287.45 million, up 54.9% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Ascendis Pharma, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on ASND going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with CHRS.Is CHRS fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.Q: It seems like the CCR-8 mechanism could be complemented by NTPD1, potentially in a bi-specific format. Does this make biological sense, and have you explored this option?A: Dr. Teresa Lavalli, Chief Scientific and Development Officer: The challenge with a bi-specific approach is that the mechanism involves binding and killing Treg cells, which might complicate inhibiting PD1 on cytotoxic T cells. While some are exploring bi-specifics for CCR8, our focus with CHS 114 is on depleting immunosuppressive Tregs and enhancing CD8 T cell infiltration. A traditional combination therapy approach might yield stronger clinical responses.Story ContinuesQ: How do you view the trajectory for Loktorzi sales, and when do you expect to reach your sales goal of $150 to $200 million by mid-2028?A: Denny Landseer, CEO: If we maintain a 10-15% growth per quarter, we should reach our target by mid-2028.

            "summary": "Coherus Oncology (CHRS) Reports Q3 Loss, Lags Revenue EstimatesZacks Equity ResearchNovember 7, 20253 min readIn this article:CHRSARMPCoherus Oncology (CHRS) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.33 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.32. This compares to a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -3.13%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this drug developer would post a loss of $0.31 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.34, delivering a surprise of -9.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.Coherus Oncology, which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $11.57 million for the quarter ended September 2025, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $70.77 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Coherus Oncology shares have added about 13.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 15.6%.What's Next for Coherus Oncology?While Coherus Oncology has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Coherus Oncology was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.30 on $14.26 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$1.31 on $56.71 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Story continuesInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a ma",
