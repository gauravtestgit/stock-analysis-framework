Such leaders can take ownership of accounting and finance, but they can also help smaller to mid-sized entities set up a game plan for their future goals: a key benefit for SMBs, which often \u201chave a lot of goals that don't fit on paper,\u201d Randall said in an interview.\u201cTell your fractional CFO about your goals that aren't in a financial statement,\u201d he advised SMB leaders. \u201c\u2018We want to hand this business down to the family, or we want to exit,\u2019 or whatever [the goal is] going to be, this is where that fractional CFO can say, \u2018Oh, great, I can help you with that.\u2019\u201dGoal-oriented financeFractional CFOs have risen in popularity over the past few years as both businesses and finance professionals contemplate new ways of working, and the need for new skills, as the rate of change continues to accelerate. Last year, thedemand for interim talentspiked threefold from its level in 2020, CFO Dive previously reported, citing a Business Talent Group report.Fractional CFOs can bring flexible financial expertise to smaller entities: but, small business owners shouldn\u2019t be afraid to tell their fractional CFOs \u201cwhat\u2019s what\u201d when it comes to their problem areas or challenges, Randall said. The finance leader is coming in looking \u201cfirst and foremost, to make an impact and to provide value\u2026but you have to be able to say, \u2018hey, this is the way we've done things to date, and this is where we want to be,\u201d he said.Randall in his role at Xero, which works with accounting firms to implement cloud-based solutions, has a \u201cwide view\u201d of the accounting profession and of the SMB sector, he said.

His past roles include serving as director of strategic operations for Health: ELT, and at health provider Cigna in roles including a five-year span as its senior auditor.The goal-oriented approach of a fractional CFO can also be a key benefit for businesses.

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the ASX over the last few months, increasing to AU$158 at one point, and dropping to the lows of AU$107. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Xero's current trading price of AU$108 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Xero\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.Is Xero Still Cheap?Xero appears to be expensive according to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 79.6x is currently well-above the industry average of 35.29x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. Another thing to keep in mind is that Xero\u2019s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards the levels of its industry peers over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it\u2019s there, it may be hard for it to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.See our latest analysis for XeroCan we expect growth from Xero?ASX:XRO Earnings and Revenue Growth January 13th 2026Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Xero. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder?It seems like the market has well and truly priced in XRO\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe XRO should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable.

Recent engagements like presenting at influential conferences and conducting an Annual General Meeting underscore its active pursuit of growth and investor confidence.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies likeXero(ASX:XRO), which has not only revenues, but also profits.

See the full list for free.Xero's Improving ProfitsXero has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. It's good to see that Xero's EPS has grown from NZ$1.42 to NZ$1.58 over twelve months. That's a 11% gain; respectable growth in the broader scheme of things.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Our analysis has highlighted that Xero's revenuefrom operationsdid not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. On the one hand, Xero's EBIT margins fell over the last year, but on the other hand, revenue grew. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.
