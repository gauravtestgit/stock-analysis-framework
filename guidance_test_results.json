The actual performance has been solid, with revenue growth of 12% and earnings roughly in line with expectations.\n4. **Forward-looking guidance credibility**: The forward-looking guidance is credible, with several new product launches planned for 2025. The raised Q4 revenue guidance and FY EPS guidance suggest a strong momentum, and the optimistic management tone reinforces this outlook.\n5. **Discrepancies between guidance, actual results, and trends**: There are no significant discrepancies between the guidance, actual results, and trends. The management guidance is aligned with the actual performance, and the positive news sentiment supports the optimistic outlook.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nBased on the analysis, the recommendation is to UPGRADE the investment rating due to the solid revenue growth, optimistic management tone, and credible forward-looking guidance.
