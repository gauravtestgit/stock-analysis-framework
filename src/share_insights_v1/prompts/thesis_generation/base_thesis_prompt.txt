**FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS**
Analyze the comprehensive financial data above. For {thesis_type_lower}, {financial_emphasis}. Explain what the metrics reveal about {financial_focus}.

**ALGORITHMIC ASSESSMENT SUMMARY**
- Current market price: {current_price_str}
- Target price analysis: Calculate and explain ${target_price:.2f} vs {current_price_str} relationship
- {probability_assessment}
- Primary {value_risk_factors} with quantified impact

**NEWS CATALYST & SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**
Analyze the news sentiment data above. For {thesis_type_lower}, {news_focus}. Reference specific news sources with their URLs and explain how developments {news_impact}. Include clickable article links for verification.

**COMPREHENSIVE INDUSTRY ANALYSIS**
- Industry positioning: Analyze outlook and competitive position data
- Porter's Five Forces assessment: Provide scores (1-5) for supplier power, buyer power, competitive rivalry, substitution threats, and barriers to entry
- {industry_emphasis}

**PRODUCT PORTFOLIO & REVENUE STREAM ANALYSIS**
Analyze product portfolio and segment revenue data. For {thesis_type_lower}, {portfolio_emphasis}. 

CRITICAL: Create a detailed revenue breakdown table using the segment revenue data provided above. Show each business segment's actual contribution to total revenue and operating income with specific dollar amounts and percentages.

**REVENUE BREAKDOWN BY BUSINESS SEGMENT:**
Use the segment revenue data to create a comprehensive table showing:
- Each business segment name and actual revenue contribution in dollars (calculate by multiplying percentage by total revenue ${total_revenue:,.0f})
- Percentage of total revenue for each segment  
- Operating margins and profitability by segment
- Growth rates and trends for each business line
- Total company revenue and aggregate metrics

CRITICAL CALCULATION REQUIREMENT: For each segment, calculate actual revenue dollars by multiplying the segment percentage by total company revenue. Do NOT use the percentage as the dollar amount.

For each segment, explain:
- Revenue contribution in both dollars and percentage (e.g., Segment A: $X.X billion, XX.X% of total revenue)
- Profitability and competitive positioning
- {segment_analysis}
