**REQUIRED ANALYSIS**
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## **PART 1: SEGMENT PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS**

For each business segment, analyze in detail:

**SEGMENT 1: {Segment_Name}**

**Current Profile:**
- Revenue Contribution: ${calculate: percentage × total_revenue} ({percentage}% of total)
- Status: {Growing/Stable/Declining}
- Classification: {Core/Growth/Emerging/Legacy/Divest candidate}

**Business Model:**
What does this segment do? How does it make money?
[1-2 sentences explaining the business model for this segment]

**Revenue Quality:**
Assess the nature of revenue:
- Recurring vs One-time: [Based on business model, what's the mix?]
- Customer Concentration: [High/Medium/Low - infer from segment type]
- Pricing Power: [Strong/Moderate/Weak - based on competitive position]
- Stickiness: [High/Medium/Low - based on switching costs]

**Competitive Position:**
- Market Position: [Leader/Strong Player/Average/Weak - infer from company competitive position]
- Differentiation: [What makes this segment competitive?]
- Competitive Threats: [What are the key risks?]

**Strategic Importance:**
- Role in Portfolio: [Cash Generator/Growth Driver/Strategic Entry/Legacy]
- Synergies with Other Segments: [Cross-sell opportunities? Shared infrastructure?]
- Strategic Rationale: [Why does company operate this segment?]

**Segment Health Score:** __/100
[Based on: size, growth status, strategic fit, competitive position]

---

[Repeat for Segment 2, Segment 3, etc.]

---

**PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION ANALYSIS:**

**Revenue Concentration:**
- Top Segment: {largest_segment} at {percentage}%
- Top 2 Segments: {percentage}% combined
- Concentration Risk: [High >70% / Medium 50-70% / Low <50%]

**Risk Assessment:**
If {largest_segment} represents {percentage}% of revenue:
→ "Company is [highly/moderately/minimally] dependent on {segment_name}. 
   If this segment [describe risk scenario], total revenue would decline {impact}%, 
   which would be [catastrophic/severe/concerning/manageable]."

**Diversification Benefits:**
- Having {number} segments provides [strong/moderate/weak] diversification
- Segments appear to be [highly correlated/somewhat correlated/independent]
- Rationale: [Explain based on segment types and industry dynamics]

**Portfolio Balance:**
[Assess mix of growth vs stability, core vs emerging, etc.]

## **PART 2: CATALYST IDENTIFICATION**

Identify potential catalysts for EACH segment over the next 12-24 months.

**Catalyst Definition:** Events or trends that could materially impact segment 
revenue, margins, or strategic value (positive or negative).

**SEGMENT 1: {Segment_Name}**

**POSITIVE CATALYSTS (Upside Drivers):**

**Catalyst 1: {Name}**
- Type: [Product Launch/Market Expansion/Partnership/Regulatory/Technology/Macro Trend]
- Timeframe: [0-6 months / 6-12 months / 12-24 months]
- Probability: [High >60% / Medium 30-60% / Low <30%]
- Potential Impact: [Transformative >20% / Significant 10-20% / Moderate 5-10% / Minor <5%]
- Evidence/Rationale: [What signals this catalyst? News? Industry trends? Company positioning?]
- Revenue Impact: If realized, could add ${estimate_range} to segment revenue

**Catalyst 2: {Name}**
[Same structure]

**NEGATIVE CATALYSTS (Downside Risks):**

**Catalyst 1: {Name}**
- Type: [Competitive Pressure/Technology Disruption/Regulatory/Customer Loss/Market Shift]
- Timeframe: [0-6 months / 6-12 months / 12-24 months]
- Probability: [High >60% / Medium 30-60% / Low <30%]
- Potential Impact: [Severe >20% decline / Significant 10-20% / Moderate 5-10% / Minor <5%]
- Evidence/Rationale: [What signals this risk? Industry trends? Competitive moves? Tech shifts?]
- Revenue Impact: If realized, could reduce segment revenue by ${estimate_range}

**Catalyst 2: {Name}**
[Same structure]

**NET CATALYST ASSESSMENT FOR SEGMENT:**
- Positive Catalysts: [Number] with combined probability-weighted impact of [+X%]
- Negative Catalysts: [Number] with combined probability-weighted impact of [-Y%]
- Net Outlook: [Strongly Positive / Positive / Neutral / Negative / Strongly Negative]
- Key Wildcard: [The one catalyst that could change everything]

---

[Repeat for each segment]

---

**PORTFOLIO-LEVEL CATALYST SYNTHESIS:**

**Most Important Catalysts (Cross-Segment):**

Rank the top 5 catalysts by impact on total company:

**1. {Catalyst Name} - {Segment}**
- Impact on Total Revenue: [X%] (affects {Y}% segment)
- Probability: [Z%]
- Timeframe: [when]
- Why It Matters: [Explain significance]

**2. {Catalyst Name} - {Segment}**
[Same structure]

[Continue through #5]

**Catalyst Clustering:**
Do multiple catalysts point to similar themes?
- [Theme 1]: [List related catalysts]
- [Theme 2]: [List related catalysts]
- [Theme 3]: [List related catalysts]

**Correlation Risk:**
Are positive/negative catalysts correlated?
[If many negative catalysts could hit simultaneously, this amplifies risk]
